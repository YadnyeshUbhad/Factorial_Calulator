# Factorial Calculator

## 📌 Overview
This **Factorial Calculator** is a simple yet efficient application that computes the factorial of a given number using both **iterative** and **recursive** methods. The calculator ensures **input validation**, **clear output display**, and can be extended with backend support using **Node.js/Express.js** or other technologies.

## 🚀 Features
- **Iterative & Recursive Calculation**: Computes factorial using both methods.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures only valid positive integers are accepted.
- **Dynamic Output Display**: Presents results clearly and interactively.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed for smooth user experience across devices.
- **Expandable Backend Support** (Optional): Can integrate with Node.js/Express.js for enhanced functionality.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js, Express.js
